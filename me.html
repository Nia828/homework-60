                    <p>I like playing the piano as I am really good at it. I have learnt the "Dance of the little Swans". My teacher tells me to play it slow, but I know how to play it faster than the original speed. I am also teaching 5 year-olds how to dance the Swan Lake ballet. I hope I am successful.</p>

                        <p>The peices I play are rather simple once mastered. My mother says that I am amazing at piano. I can play the whole "Dance of the Little Swans" with my eyes closed. My goal is to play the peice faster than Peter Tchaicovsky, the composer and any other ballet academy. I hope I achieve it.
